My curiosity about how things work fuels my persistence and motivation, driving me to explore complex systems and push the boundaries of what's possible. When I'm not working on software projects, I love spending time outdoors, exploring the natural beauty of Vancouver Island through hiking, caving, and mine exploration. These experiences help me maintain a healthy work-life balance and inspire me to create innovative solutions to technical challenges.",
